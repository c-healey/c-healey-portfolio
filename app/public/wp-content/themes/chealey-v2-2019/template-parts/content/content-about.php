                    <p class="paragraph">I’m returning to my software development roots after a long break. I like the creativity in building things.  I like a degree of stability too.  When the 2007 great recession hit I was laid off when Cerberus acquired Chrysler from Daimler. My friends who stayed in development had work, I did not.  The demand for software developers is high and the obstacles to learning gone. I’m back doing one of my favorite things. </p>
